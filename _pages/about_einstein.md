My name is liujiangchen . I came from Chuzhou, Anhui Province , a city with beautiful scenery and rich history. And, I graduated from Northeastern University and majored in Japanese.
During my 4-years study at Northeastern University, I participated in many campus activities and passed CET-6. Moreover , I constantly seek opportunities outside campus to improve my abilities. For example, I took part in the internship of Shenyang Radio and TV Station and became a video creator of Tiktok , which provides me the ability to communicate greatly and solve problems more fluently.
In my daily life, I enjoy reading news, as this activity trains me to exercise my thinking ability and to broaden my horizons, and these skills are transferrable when reflecting on academic issues.
